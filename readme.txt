A small plugin for the All-in-One Event Calendar to convert calendar events to plain text when exported to other calendars.

== Description ==

This plugin will convert exported calendar events from the All-in-One Event Calendar to plain text.  Where possible, formatting is kept.

Links are preserved by including references to them in the notes footer.

Many thanks to Jon Abernathy, aka Chuggnutt over at chuggnutt.com who saved me a lot of time with his HTML to Text class. It was the second class I tried, and the better of the two by a good margin.

Sample output:

	This is a paragraph, followed by a linked list: 

 	* 'line one of an indented list'
 	* 'line two of an indented list'

	This paragraph provides examples of links.  Here is the support website[1].
